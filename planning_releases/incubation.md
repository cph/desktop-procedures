# [Planning Releases](../planning_releases.md) / Incubation


#### Rationale

We want to meet frequently for three reasons:

 1. To keep efforts between teams (e.g. Development, Support, and Marketing) synchronized
 2. To get quick feedback about questions or insights generated by development
 3. To progressively define upcoming milestones ["just-in-time"](../reference/late_binding.md)


#### Procedure

 - Product Teams with active roadmaps meet on Friday mornings for Incubation. The Product Team consists of the following people but others may participate in Incubation as needed:
     - The Marketing Manager
     - The Manager of Support
     - The Manager of EP
     - The Product Designer
     - The Project Maintainer
