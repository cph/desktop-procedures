# [Planning Releases](../planning_releases.md) / Roadmapping


#### Rationale

Our [planning process](../planning_releases.md) tries to achieve transparency, late-binding, and progressive definition through short feedback loops. Our primary feedback loop is the weekly [Incubation](incubation.md); but conversations about strategy — and synthesis of recent feedback — require a longer (and therefore less frequent) meeting.


#### Tools Used

 - Houston Feedback
 - [Jira](https://concordiapublishing.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/EP/boards/5/timeline)
 - [Roadmap Visualization](http://ep-grand-central.herokuapp.com/dashboards/roadmap)


#### Procedure

 - Product Teams with active roadmaps meet quarterly for Roadmapping. The Product Team consists of:
    - The Marketing Manager
    - The Manager of Support
    - The Manager of EP
    - The Product Designer
    - The Project Maintainer

###### Before Roadmapping

 - Participants should gather input from their teams (if applicable).

###### During Roadmapping

 - The Product Designer may make an official report summarizing and synthesizing feedback.
 - The team should come to a consensus about the upcoming quarters' goals.

###### After Roadmapping

 - Participants should communicate the strategy and vision of the Product Team to their teams (if applicable).
