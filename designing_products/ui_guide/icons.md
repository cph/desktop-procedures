# [Designing Products](../../designing_products.md) / UI Guide / Icons

#### Goals

We develop custom icon sets for our products for two reasons:

1. Beauty implies craftsmanship
2. To optimize "reading" the interface


#### Rationale

###### "Reading" the interface

Icons are poor at **_revealing_** or **_explaining_** new features to users. They are not a tool for aiding discoverability, but they are useful in two scenarios:

1. A user has a feature in mind, scans a toolbar for it, and tries icons that remind him of the feature he wants.
2. A user discovers new features by reading text in menus. The text is paired with a memorable icon and, after learning the association, the user doesn't have to read the text, she recognizes the option by its icon.

###### Conclusions

- In the second scenario, the association between text and icon doesn't have to be self-evident; it only has to be memorable _after the association is made._
- In both scenarios, the user has the wanted feature in mind and the icon serves as a mnemonic or metonymy for it.


#### Processes

- Icons fail to imply craftsmanship if they're not of a consistent visual style; therefore we commission icons from a designer rather than grabbing them from around the Internet. Sara Hasz designed most of the icons for Church360ยบ.
- Bob's process for designing icons with Sara broke the work into two steps:
   1. Decide on the right **visual noun**
   2. Iterate on the icon


#### Example

> Let's say we need an icon for users and I'm considering **profile**, **id-badge**, and **contact-card** as visual nouns. I'll search https://thenounproject.com for things like `person`, `profile`, `user`, `id badge`, `driver's license`, `business card`, `rolodex card` and screenshot icons with features I like. Then I'll slack those screenshots to Sara, describe what nouns I'm considering, and what I like about the screenshots I grabbed from The Noun Project.
>
> Sometimes I'd have already decided on a visual noun before I messaged Sara; sometimes we'd explore several at once; and sometimes I'd ask Sara to help me think of more visual nouns.
>
> Once we'd picked the visual noun, Sara would create icons and slack them back. We'd then iterate on them until they fit well with the rest of the icons in the set and looked good in the app.
