# [Developing Features](../developing_features.md) / Task Slicing

#### Goals

This process helps us to:

 - identify questions (and obstacles) sooner
 - estimate the scope of the project more accurately
 - break hard problems into simple ones
 - generally know what discrete task is next on our to-do list


#### Tools Used

 - [Project Roadmaps](https://houst.in/roadmaps) (Houston)
 - Todoist


#### Procedures

 - Create projects in Todoist that correspond to milestones in the Roadmap
 - Link Todoist Projects to Roadmap Milestones so that the Roadmap can show progress
 - Slice Milestones into smaller tasks. As a rule of thumb, **tasks should take four hours or less to complete**.
