# [Developing Features](../developing_features.md) / Task Slicing

#### Goals

This process helps us to:

 - identify questions (and obstacles) sooner
 - estimate the scope of the project more accurately
 - break hard problems into simple ones
 - generally know what discrete task is next on our to-do list


#### Tools Used

 - [Project Roadmaps](https://houst.in/roadmaps) (Houston)
 - A todo app


#### Procedures

 - Create a project in your todo app that corresponds to a milestone in the Roadmap
 - Slice Milestones into smaller tasks in the todo app project. As a rule of thumb, **tasks should take four hours or less to complete**.
