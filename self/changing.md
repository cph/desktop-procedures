# Changing our Desktop Procedures

#### Rationale

If "how we work" was a codebase, we'd have the same ideals for it that we do for our code:
 - We'd want fast deploys so that our teammates could benefit from improvements quickly.
 - We'd want it to be easy to change.
 - We'd want a `script/bootstrap` so new coworkers could hit the ground running.
 - We'd want test-specs so we know whether a process is working.
 - We'd want a `git blame` so we could see why a process got added.

That's why:
 - We keep our desktop procedures on the Web, so they're always up-to-date.
 - We keep our desktop procedures in a repo so that we can accept pull requests to it.
 - We organize them starting with Essential Responsibilities so that it's easier to see how the procedures fit together.
 - We include **Goals** and **Rationale** along with **Procedures** so that we can see what a process is attempting to solve â€” which makes it easier to change.

#### Procedure

 1. Clone the repo (or [use GitHub's Edit File feature](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/)) to make changes and create a pull request for them.
 2. Follow [the style guide](style_guide.md) for our Desktop Procedures.
 3. We'll talk through changes during our weekly Retrospectives and merge or discard them then.
