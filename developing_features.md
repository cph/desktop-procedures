# Developing Features

#### Rationale

This is the primary way that our team creates value for CPH and her customers.

#### Goals

These processes should ensure:
  1. that we're building that right thing
  2. that what we're building is reliable and maintainable
  3. that our progress is visible

#### Procedures

 - [Product Teams](the_product_team.md) with active roadmaps meet weekly for [Incubation][incubation.md]. These meetings allow teams to check in frequently and to refine plans.
 - After Incubation meetings, we [plan next week's Sprint](sprint_planning.md). This process helps us to identify obstacles early and sets a team goal for the following week.
 - We write code according to our [style guides](https://github.com/cph/style-guides) so our codebases are as readable as possible.
 - We guard critical logic with [unit tests](test_driven_development.md) to protect against regressions and to support [refactoring](refactoring.md).
 - We [code review](code_review.md) all work before merging and deploying it.
