# Designing Products


#### Overview

We support greenfield product development and ideation a couple of ways: (a) by helping to incubate new products through prototyping, etc, (b) by giving estimates for new products' features, helping coworkers weigh the costs of considered projects.

We also do a lot of design-work related to current roadmaps. See [Planning Releases](planning_releases.md).
