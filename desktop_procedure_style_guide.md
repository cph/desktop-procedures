# Desktop Procedure Style Guide

There are three types of articles:

##### Essential Responsibilities

These are the [six main articles](README.md) and are formatted as follows:

 - Each has four sections:
    1. **Rationale** (_optional_) can provide background information for the article's Goals.
    2. **Goals** state 5 or fewer things we most desire to be true while we execute this responsibility. We'll replace specific procedures below if they can help us accomplish these goals better.
    3. **Procedures** describe, in story form and succinctly, the processes that support the goals we have for this responsibility.
    4. **Related Topics** are links to other essential responsibilities that either precede or follow this one.


##### Specific Procedures

Any other procedure is formatted as follows:

 - Each has three sections:
   1. **Rationale** (_optional_) can provide background information about the procedure.
   2. **Tools Used** (_optional_) lists the programs (or [ep](https://github.com/cph/ep) commands or [Houston](https://github.com/cph/our-houston) views) that are used during the procedure.
   3. **Procedure** describes, in detail, how this task is currently done.


##### Support Articles

These (like this one) just explain a particular concept and are organized by the content.
