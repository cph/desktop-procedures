# Planning Releases


#### Rationale

Product Development is an activity that generates information. Efforts to implement a domain yield new insights into that domain. Releases in response to feedback elicit new feedback. Customers' needs, our understanding of their needs, markets, and technical possibilities all constantly change. All these changes affect the payoff of a plan, meaning that the optimal path forward is always a moving target.

At the same time, the _process of planning_ is our first opportunity to anticipate research and design needs or architectural constraints. And plans themselves allow us to synchronize work with other teams like Marketing and Support.

###### Conclusion

Our planning process should be characterized by transparency, [late-binding](reference/late_binding.md), and progressive definition.


#### Goals

Our planning process should maximize:

 1. Our access to information about our customers
 2. Our ability to change plans in response to new information
 3. The visibility of our plans and transparency of our planning


#### Procedures

 - We gather feedback from our customers through Sales, Support, and research into one place where it can be categorized and searched.
 - Product Teams meet quarterly for [Roadmapping](planning_releases/roadmapping.md). These longer meetings allow them to review feedback and revise goals (a.k.a. milestones) for the upcoming quarter.
 - Product Teams with active roadmaps meet weekly for [Incubation](planning_releases/incubation.md). These meetings allow teams to check in frequently and to progressively define upcoming milestones.
 - When Product Teams identify gaps in their understanding of customers, the Product Designer and UX Team conduct research to fill them.
 - Ahead of upcoming milestones, Product Designers turn goals into specific User Stories and specify how new features should look and behave.
 - At the start of a milestone, developers [break User Stories into specific tasks](developing_features/task_slicing.md).
